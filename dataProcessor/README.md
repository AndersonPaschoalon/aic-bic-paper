# DataProcessorPrototype
This is a prototype of the DataProcessor Component, written in Matlab. This should validade the used models for fitting data, for further codification in C++.


#scripts:

### ./dataProcessor.m <experiment-name>
This scrit performs all calculations and generate simulated data.

### ./modelFittingEvaluation-plots.sh <experiment-name>
This script plot the data generated by "./dataProcessor.m".

### ./plotCostFunction.sh <experiment-name>
This script plots the cost function of of the simulations.

### ./run.sh  <experiment-name>
Run all these scripts in sequence
